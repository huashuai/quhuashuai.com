*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，本期是关于中年危机以及哈利王子从阿富汗回到英国的新闻。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*  

听写的第二天，随着适应之后，对于慢速VOA的感觉相对不错，除了一些专有的人名，地名，基本上不会遇到什么障碍，当然这些内容随着熟悉接，接触的越来越多会好起来的；对于标准VOA，确实存在很多问题，一是语速，一是发音。语速导致有些连读或者吞音的地方不容易听出来，虽然不太影响对整句意思的理解，但是这也正是听写和听的区别。另一方面，发音也会导致有的词明明知道，却听不出来，这也需要适应，想印度那一带的发音，真的很不习惯，经常要pardon……

第二天的任务完成，又到了吃饭去学校的时间了，现在是早上七点钟，国内的朋友已经是下午了，大家赶紧行动起来，开始今天的听写吧!

`A new study shows that unhappiness in middle age, also known as midlife crisis, is a universal experience. Two economists did the study: Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick in England and David Blanchflower at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. They used information collected earlier on two million people from eighty nations.`

They found that people around the world seem to share an emotional
design in life. That design, they say, is shaped like the letter U.
Levels of happiness are highest when people are young, and when they are
old. In the middle, however, most people's happiness and life
satisfaction levels drop.

Professor Olswald says, some people suffer from middle life depression
more than others. But he says it happens to man and woman, to single and
married people, to rich and poor, and to those with and without
children.

Generally speaking, people reach their lowest levels between the ages of
about 40 and 55. But then, as they continue into old age, their
happiness starts to climb back up. What the research does not show is
why all this happens. Professor Oswald says one possibility is that
people recognize their limitations in middle age and give up on some
long-held dreams.</code>

`When details of Prince Harry's tour of duty were disclosed in the media, it became clear that his time at a forward base in volatile Helmand Province was drawing to a close. In fact the Prince called himself a “bullet magnet”. `

On Saturday, his father Prince Charles and his older brother Prince
William met Harry at Brize Norton air base near Oxford. Charles said he
now knows what being a parent of a son or daughter on active duty can do
to your nerves.

“While being incredibly proud of Harry, I am, I promise you, equally
proud to what it is worth of all the dedicated service given by all our
armed forces.”

Reacting to Prince Harry's return, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the
right decision was made to get him out of Afghanistan. He said security
considerations for the prince were paramount.

“I think the whole country is going to be delighted that Prince Harry
has come back safely, that his security has been protected. Very
grateful to him for the work he has done in Afghanistan. Very grateful
to all the soldiers as he is for the support they gave him and also for
what they are doing for their country.</code>[display\_podcast]
