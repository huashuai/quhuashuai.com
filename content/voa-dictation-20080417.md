*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是数学教育的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是关于韩国总统访美的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

对于慢速VOA，没什么难度，当然是你要知道加减乘除的英语怎么说，还有代数这样的词，相信多数人都知道这几个词。而标准VOA当中语速感觉有点快，听的时候稍微有些麻烦，一句话经常需要听很多遍才可以，尽管很费劲的听完了，不过错误还是可以，这也许就是进步？

</p>

今天因为早上一早去了英国使馆签证，所以早上就没有听完，到了晚上这才把标准VOA听了。好累啊，其实想每天都坚持做这么一件事情感觉没有那么容易，本来以为自己可以很容易的做到的，继续努力吧！现在仿佛进入一个奇怪的状态，就是不想听，哎……

**题目**: Searching for Better Ways to Teach Math in US　(1/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: N/A

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> A committee has released its final report on ways to improve math
> education for American students. President Bush created the National
> Mathematics Advisory Panel two years ago. The panel examined thousands
> of reports, along with survey results from more than seven hundred
> algebra teachers. Yet the report, released last month, is short on
> detailed advice. It says existing research does not show just what
> knowledge or skills are needed for effective math teaching.
> <font color="red">The solution? More research.</font> The report does
> say basic math skills must be taught completely in the early years of
> school. Children should be able to add and subtract in the third
> grade. By the end of fifth grade, they should be able to multiply and
> divide. Teachers should avoid revisiting skills year after year. And,
> the experts say, it is wrong to think children are too young or not
> ready to learn certain content at certain ages. The report says a
> major goal for kindergarten through eighth grade should be
> understanding fractions. These skills are needed for algebra. Yet, the
> report says, at the present time they seem to be severely
> underdeveloped in American students.

**题目**: S.Korean President Leaves For Summit Aimed At Better Ties With
US, Japan

</p>

**专有名词**: Pyongyang（平壤）, Yu Myung-hwan, Singapore

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> The North tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006,
> ~~(and)~~<font color="red">an</font> event some say was made easier by
> the relatively uncritical transfers of billions of dollars worth of
> aid and investment from the South. President Lee, a conservative
> former ~~(cooperate)~~<font color="red">corporate</font> chairman,
> says the South will continue to help the North, but only if Pyongyang
> cooperates on getting rid of its nuclear weapons. He says South Korea
> will persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear
> ~~(programs)~~<font color="red">program</font> through ongoing
> six-nation diplomacy, and that the North must come to realize that
> ending its nuclear programs will be beneficial. North Korea is now
> nearly five months overdue in providing a declaration of its nuclear
> activities that it promised to produce by the end of last year. A
> recent U S-North Korea meeting in Singapore has fostered hope
> ~~(of)~~<font color="red">a</font> breakthrough may be near. South
> Korean Foreign Minister <font color="red">Yu Myung-hwan</font> says he
> hopes the negotiations can get back to a brisk pace. He says South
> Korea believes the multinational nuclear diplomacy needs to resume by
> next month, and that the six nations should ideally sign a new phase
> of <font color="red">a</font> disarmament agreement by August.
