*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是女性教育投资的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是安吉丽娜朱莉的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

昨天第一次修改了听写文本的发布格式，今天又稍作修改，把错误del掉，正确的用红色展示出来，这样应该更清晰，更明白。不过自己的错误都被大家看到了，哈哈！敢于亮出自己的错误，这样才更加真实！反正自己平时写Blog，听写VOA都是用gvim，再加上html的插件，插入几个小小的tag还是很方便的，所以也耽误不了太多的时间。不知道你们觉得这样子如何呢？

> "We met with these refugees, many of whom had been ~~(middle
> class)~~<font color="red">middle-class</font> and educated citizens
> back in Iraq. We met with them in cold, crowded rooms in the ~~(poor
> section)~~<font color="red">poorest sections</font> of
> ~~(\#)~~<font color="red">Amman</font> and
> ~~(Damasks)~~<font color="red">Damascus,</font> where they are

> He ~~(says)~~<font color="red">said</font> Jordan and Syria have
> stretched their own already overcrowded schools to the limits and
> ~~(their)~~<font color="red">that</font> relief efforts to build more
> schools and provide more books should include local children in host
> countries. Jolie ~~(says)~~<font color="red">said</font> the vast
> majority of Iraqi children have been traumatized by the horrors of war
> and now have special needs.
>
> "~~(Those)~~<font color="red">These</font> children are also
> traumatized. One in every five Iraqi registered in Syria is registered
> as a victim of torture or extreme violence. There was also a study
> done, that find that not surprisingly, 92 percent of the children in
> Iraq had learning impediments, due to a climate
> <font color="red">of</font> fear."
>
> Jolie said there are no easy solutions to improve access to education
> in Iraq, but efforts should focus on improving education
> infrastructure for refugees in host countries, providing books and
> supplies, recruiting teachers and integrating school dropouts,
> especially girls.
