*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是亚洲HIV的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是关于肯尼亚的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

慢速VOA的部分还是很简单的，尤其是和今天的标准VOA来比较的话。没有任何的生词，没有任何的难点，相信听过的朋友都会有这样的感觉。

</p>

今天的标准VOA，不管你以前参与过没有，都来试试看吧！第一段的采访直接听崩溃了，不知道英语说成这样怎么听啊！除了第一段之外，基本上没有什么难点。

</p>

希望今天是最后一次在晚上进行VOA听写了，从明天开始重新开始自己早起的习惯，今天基本上从前几天的疲劳当中缓解过来了。

**题目**: The Future of a Vaccine, and New Warning for Asia (1/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: Chakravarchi Rangarajan（诡异的印度人名）

</p>

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> A new study says Asia must do more to prevent AIDS, or the number of
> people infected with HIV could double by 2020.
>
> Today about 5 million people in Asia are living with the virus that
> causes AIDS. An estimated three hundred thousand people died of
> HIV-related diseases in Asia last year. At current rates, that number
> could rise to almost five hundred thousand.
>
> The United Nations program on HIV/AIDS requested the study, led by
> Indian economist Chakravarchi Rangarajan. The report says 3 main
> groups are driving the spread of AIDS in Asia. One group is sex
> workers and the men who use them. Another is injection drug users who
> share needles. And the third group are men who have unprotected sex
> with other men.
>
> Researchers estimate that as many as 10 million women in Asia sell
> sex. At least 75 million men buy on a regular basis. In many Asian
> countries, these men and their female partners represent the largest
> group of people living with HIV. The study found that AIDS is the most
> likely cause of death and lost work days for people in Asia between
> the ages of 15 and 44.

==================================================

**题目**: Rainly Season Threatens Kenya's Internally Displaced (2/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: Rift Valley, Nakuru, Nairobi, Naomi Shaaban

</p>

**重点总结**: 第一段怎么听？

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> “These are naturally in such times, only that now there are more
> children out in these circumstances, there are more vulnerable people.
> Obviously the children play around in these camps and it is a
> challenge. You cannot stop children from playing, but they are playing
> in very muddy areas, diseases are likely to occur selective.”
>
> So far the rains have been particular concerns for camps around the
> Rift valley town Nakuru, where residents have been relocated to higher
> ground. But if strong winds continue there could be increasing
> problems elsewhere. The largest concentration of camps is in the Rift
> Valley, and around the capital Nairobi.
>
> Many of those displaces belong to ethnic minorities in their
> communities and have their homes attacked by members of other tribes,
> often neighbors. Many IDPs say the government must take steps to
> ensure security before they will be willing to return.
>
> Special Program Minister Naomi Shaaban, who is in charge of
> resettlement policy, has said the government requires more money to
> implement programs but he has given little indication of what the
> timeline might look like.
