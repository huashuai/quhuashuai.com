*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，本期的慢速VOA是关于可持续发展的第二部分，标准VOA则是关于不发达地区的音乐教育的新闻的第二部分。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*  

今天是听写的第9天。今天的慢速VOA中，无论是片段的理解还是单词的辨识上，都没有什么难点。不过仍然建议大家记住麻萨诸塞州的拼写Massachusetts，很多人知道MIT，可是估计很多人不能把这个词正确的拼写出来。今天的标准VOA感觉还是比较难听的，主要还是因为口音的问题，无论是主持人还是新闻里被采访的对象，他们的发音都造成了不少的麻烦。大家不妨听听看，很多地方其实很简单，就是听不出来，哎……水平不行啊！  

第9天的任务完成，相信看到这篇文章的时候，国内的朋友已经是在下午了，大家赶紧行动起来，开始今天的听写吧!

`Rachel Glennerster runs the Abdul Latif Jameel poverty action lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The research lab does development and poverty studies. Its goal is to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs in the United States and other countries. Ms. Glennerster tells us that several studies by the research group's economists have proven that small price changes have a big influence on the number of people who use a product. A price change will reduce the total amount of use of the product as well, she says. The economists have also found no evidence that the very act of paying for something changes how people use it. Finally some development experts argue that pricing is useful when targeting a product among special populations. When it comes to bed nets, Ms. Glennerster says research shows no evidence of this. People are just as likely to use a bed net if they paid for it or not.`

`Hout Bay is a beautiful place, fifty miles outside of Cape Town. Today it has all kinds of social economic groups and many cultures living together. A little bay with harbours, mountains and magnificent beach views. Extremely wealthy people live close to the mountains, while the middle class resides in the valley. Lower income people live closer to the beach, with a poor residing in townships full of wooden homes and shacks. `

One such community is the informal settlement call Imizamo Yethu, which
is Xhosa for” Our Own Efforts”. Imizamo Yethu is home to many of the
children who take part in the Hout Bay music project.

Leanne Dollman is the head of the efforts. “I knew that township kids
don't access to art education, and there's just no way to develop
talent, especially music. If it requires an instrument very difficult
for the kids to get hold of instruments. So when I moved to Hout Bay, I
knew that was what I wanted to do, to try to get some instruments and
give some children the opportunity to enjoy their
music.”</code>[display\_podcast]
