*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是环境问题的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是美国大选的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天到了晚上才开始听写, 本来是想把明天的一起听写了的,
因为后面几天的听写都没法按时完成了. 明天去荷兰找同学玩, 到三号才回来,
正好明天是荷兰的女王节, 去看看到底是什么样子.

</p>

其实最近还是很忙的, 正好抽劳动节休息一下, 回来就要搞定美国的签证,
打算把在瑞典签证的经过写写, 好像还没看到有朋友介绍过, 我先去探路了.
这个月的博客总结估计也写不了了, 如果明天可能的话借同学的电脑试试.
提前祝大家节日快乐!

**题目**: Clinton Challenges Obama to Debate (1/2)

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Clinton is trailing Obama in delegates and in the popular vote, and
> she has been putting pressure on him to hold more debates before the
> May 6 primary elections in Indiana and in the southern state of North
> Carolina. On Saturday, Clinton called for a 90-minute debate without a
> moderator.
>
> "I hope we will be able to have a good old-fashioned Lincoln-Douglas
> debate right here in Indiana, so that you can see for yourself to make
> the decision about who our next president should be."
>
> The style of debating where each side presents an argument gets its
> name from the 1858 debates in Illinois between US Senate Candidates
> Abraham Lincoln and Steven Douglas. Obama's campaign
> ~~aids~~<font color="red">aides</font> say they are studying the
> debate request. Obama has complained <font color="red">that</font>in
> the last debate on April 16th, the moderators focused too much on
> political trivia, and too little on real issues. Clinton told
> ~~the~~<font color="red">a</font> crowd in South
> <font color="red">Bend,</font> Indiana Saturday she is focusing on the
> substance of the issues while Obama is relying on style.
>
> "I have been <font color="red">very</font>specific, across Indiana and
> America to talk about solutions. Because my campaign is about
> solutions, not speeches. It is about working to make the changes that
> we know we must have.
>
