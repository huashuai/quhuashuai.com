*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是美国数学教育的新闻第二部分，标准VOA则是教皇访美的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天又晚了！不过今天看到了两个朋友的留言，都说不要放弃应该坚持下去，谢谢你们的支持！我想自己是不会放弃的，不过由于最近感觉事情确实多，有点疲劳，不过VOA是一定会继续下去的。另外就是要坚持First
Things
First的原则，其实早上还是有时间能完成听写的，所以以后起来先做这件事情，新闻往后拖拖再看。

</p>

今天的标准VOA还是有不小的难度的，什么时候标准能听好了估计进步就不错了。准备继续坚持每天听写标准和慢速，最起码在这个月当中，下个月看看是不是把慢速换成别的什么内容来听写。另外，继续第八天没有发表任何文章……

</p>

**词汇**: N/A

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Schools are urged to prepare more students to take algebra by the
> eighth grade. Many people think math success depends largely on
> natural talent or ability; the experts say it depends on effort.
> Studies have shown that children improve in math when they believe
> that their efforts to learn make them "smarter. " The report also
> calls for strengthening the math preparation of elementary and middle
> school teachers. And it urges publishers to shorten math textbooks,
> which are often up to a thousand pages long. The panel
> ~~(says)~~<font color="red">said</font> math books are much smaller in
> many nations where students do better in math than American children.
> Publishers say American textbooks have to meet the goals of different
> states for what should be taught in each grade. The report also calls
> for more research on the effects of using calculators. Many algebra
> teachers expressed concern about their use in the lower grades. And
> the report says gifted students who can move through the material much
> faster than others should be permitted to do so. The math panel says
> the educational system needs major changes. If not, it warns that the
> United States will lose the mathematical leadership it possessed
> during most of the twentieth century.

> Catholic priests has caused great suffering for the church in America
> and for him personally. The pope says he is deeply ashamed by the
