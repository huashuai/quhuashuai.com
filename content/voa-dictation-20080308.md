*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，本期的慢速VOA是关于好莱坞的，标准VOA则是关于社区安全的新闻。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*  

今天是听写的第六天了，今天的慢速VOA中获奖人名以及电影比较多，所以遇到了一些小麻烦。Hugh自己感觉对于这些专有人名地名接触多了应该就熟悉了，就像中文里的一些流行词汇一样，明星的名字总是容易记住的。标准VOA部分整体意思听明白没有问题，可是在听写过程中会在很多小的点上出现问题，甚至有时候连断句都不对。另外有的时候像kit这个词，不是不知道可是听到了也没有想到，反而直接想成key，kid，所以根据语境判断词的能力也需要提高。  

第六天的任务完成，今天因为快6点钟才起来，所以晚了一会，吃饭去了！国内的朋友已经是下午了，大家赶紧行动起来，开始今天的听写吧!

`This year, something happened that  the Academic Awards that had not happened since 1964. All the winners for best acting were from outside United States. Daniel Day-Lewis and Tilda Swinton are British. He won best actor for “There Will Be Blood”, She won best supporting actress for “Michael Clayton”. French actress Marion Cotillard won the Oscar in “La Vie en Rose”. And Spain's Javier Bardem won best supporting actor in “No Country for Old Man”. Hollywood is increasingly looking outside America's borders for stars and profit. Jonathan Taplin is a professor at the USC Annenberg school for communication at the university of Southern California. He says that today, about 54 percent of the tickets sales for Hollywood studios now come from outside the United States. For the last three months of 2007, foreign sales totalled about 880,000,000 dollars. But there is fierce competition for each movie dollar. Hollywood has lost market share in some places, as other countries developed their own film industries. For example, in the middle 80s, American films had 80 percent of the market in South Korea. Today that share is about 40 percent.`

`More than 50 community organizations took part of the recent forum that focused on a flu pandemics. But Dr. Jonathan Fielding, public health director for Los Angeles County, says the preparations are much the same for natural disaster and terrorism.“We know we're quite susceptible to earthquakes, we've just had wildfires, we just did tsunami exercise even though that's less likely. A pandemic will occur - we just don't know when. We are concerned about man-made disasters. Unfortunately, we have to worry about bio-terrorism, chemical, radiological terrorism. So the good news is being prepared for all of them requires the same basic ingredients, which is a emergency communication plan, emergence preparedness kit and understanding in communities what you will do in the event of the problem.”He said each family need a plan, in place in case of disaster, when phone service is maybe down and travel difficult. He said people need emergence supplies, including medicine and bandages. a flashlight, battery-powered radio, water, food and other essential. He adds  community  organizations should have plan in place to supplement the work of public agencies.`[display\_podcast]
