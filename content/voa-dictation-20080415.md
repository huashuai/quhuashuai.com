*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是中年腹部肥胖的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是关于布什谈伊拉克的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

今天早上没有来得及最后修改发布，所以又晚了一点。这几天有些混乱，好像事情有些杂乱，搞的心情不太好，尽管事情还是按部就班，不过感觉有些事情进步似乎很小，或者是自己根本感觉不到进步，这真的是挺郁闷的事情，当然不是指VOA听写了。今天的听写也不难，忽略掉那些非常奇怪的词汇的话，不过听多了写多了还是能记住几个的。

==================================================

**题目**: Study Links Midlife Belly Fat to Higher Risk of
Dementia　(1/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: Dementia, Alzheimer, Kaiser Permanente

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Being overweight can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes and heart
> attacks. But now there may be another reason to lose the fat,
> especially around the middle of the body. A recent study suggested
> that people in their forties with belly fat have an increased risk of
> dementia later in life. Dementia is the name for a group of brain
> disorders that affect memory, behavior, learning and language.
>
> ~~(Osihimer)~~<font color="red">Alzheimer's</font> disease is the most
> common cause. Dementia rarely appears before the age of sixty. The new
> study added to growing evidence that people with large stomachs can
> face greater health risks than others who are overweight. The study
> involved more than six thousand northern California members of
> ~~(Kizer Permanenty)~~<font color="red">Kaiser Permanente,</font> a
> health care organization.
>
> Researchers looked at the patients' medical records from between
> nineteen sixty-four and nineteen seventy-three. The people were in
> their early to mid-forties at the time. They were all part of a
> long-term health study that included measurements of belly fat. The
> researchers compared the records with those from when the patients
> were in their seventies. By that time, almost one out of six of them
> ~~(have)~~<font color="red">had</font> dementia. The researchers found
> that dementia was more common in those with wider bellies.

**题目**: Bush Says Iraqi Security Improving (2/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: al-Qaida, Iran, Kentucky, John Yarmuth, Afghanistan

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Troops ~~(deployed)~~<font color="red">deploying</font> to Iraq or
> Afghanistan after August 1st will have their tour of duty reduced from
> 15 months to 12 months. The war in Iraq is deeply unpopular in the
> United States. A majority of Americans now believe toppling Saddam
> Hussein was a mistake. A public opinion poll by the Associated Press
> this past week showed nearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of how
> President Bush is handling the war. In the Democratic party's radio
> address, Kentucky Congressman John
> ~~(Yama)~~<font color="red">Yarmuth</font> focused on the continuing
> cost of the war, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
> says it is as much as 9 billion a month.
> ~~(Yama)~~<font color="red">Yarmuth says</font> Iraq's government is
> enjoying a multi-billion dollar surplus while Americans pay the
> salaries of Iraqi security forces. President Bush this past week said
> there is no doubt the cost of the war is great, but he said it is a
> modest fraction of the nation's wealth and is a burden worth bearing
> because Iraq is a focal point for what he called the greatest threat
> to America, al-Qaida and Iran.
