*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是清洁型厨灶的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是关于美国总统候选人的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天的慢速VOA难度也不是很大，除了象equity这个词确实听了也不知道是什么，其他地方还是时态以及单复数的问题，有一个值得注意的就是will和would好像总是搞错，很奇怪，也不知道为什么！

</p>

今天的标准VOA当中可能比较困难的就是，采访对象的英音依然有些不适应，不过播音员的语音也够可以的了。第二段采访的should是怎么也没听出来，总觉得有个单词，可是就是不知道是什么。还是需要继续加强，感觉这个听力问题任重道远啊！

<p>
> </p>
> This week the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
> existing homes in the United States increased almost 3 percent in
> February. It was the first increase since last July.
>
> But fueling that increase was a drop in prices. The S&P/Case-Shiller
> index of 20 major markets showed that home prices fell almost two and
> a half percent in January. Prices were down almost 11 percent from a
> year before.
>
> And still another report this week showed that sales of new
> single-family houses fell in February. Sales were down almost 2
> percent from January to a 13-year low.
>
> The Commerce Department estimated there was a ten-month supply of
> newly built houses waiting to be sold. Experts say prices in many
> markets will have to fall further before more people are willing or
> able to buy.
>
> Prices went up and up in recent years, before the housing bubble
> burst. Many buyers now struggling to make payments took out loans that
> were too big . They thought prices would keep rising and they could
> sell their home for a nice profit. Rising values meant that people
> could also take out home equity loans and lines of credit. They used
> their home as a cash machine by borrowing against its value.
