*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是女性教育投资的新闻第二部分，标准VOA则是布什谈论伊拉克的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天头一回慢速VOA没有出现错误，不知道是不是自己核对的不够仔细，因为沪江的对比器似乎有点问题，今天总是不能完全比对。而今天的标准VOA当中有些很奇怪的词，确实不知道是什么，专门上网上查了一下，象Shi'ites这个词，到wikipedia上查，也会redirect到Shia上，而且文中听得好像就是Shia啊，或者和阿拉伯语的发音有关系，不知道了。另外象al-Qaida这个词也有些奇怪，似乎按照我拼写的al-Qaeda也对，wikipedia上是这么说的。

</p>

**专有名词**: Goldman Sachs Group, Afghanistan, Cairo

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Dina Powell is the managing director of Goldman Sachs. She says that
> 10,000 Women is not a "one size fits all" program. Each university
> decides what to teach to fulfill local needs. At the American
> University of Afghanistan, for example, women will study the general
> ideas of business management. But at the American University in Cairo,
> Egypt, the partner school will offer beginning and higher-level
> business classes to the first 500 women. Such classes may include
> financial record keeping, market research and advertising. Women also
> could learn how to write a business plan, do business over the
> internet or gain investors.
>
> Goldman Sachs plans to give 100 million dollars to the 10,000 Women
> program over the next 5 years. It also will urge its employees to
> donate their time and knowledge in the classroom. The program is based
> on a Goldman Sachs research report called "women hold up half the
> sky". The research shows the powerful effects that working women have
> on their nations' economies and societies.

> In the 15 months since he ordered more US troops to Iraq, President
> Bush said there has been a major strategic shift, with many mainstream
> ~~(Suni)~~<font color="red"> Sunnis</font> and
> ~~(Shia)~~<font color="red">Shi'ites</font> now actively confronting
> extremists.

> "Fifteen months ago, ~~(al-Qaeda)~~<font color="red">al-Qaida</font>

> Today, we have put ~~(al-Qaeda)~~<font color="red">al-Qaida</font> on
> ~~(a defense)~~<font color="red">the defensive</font> in Iraq, and now
> we are working to deliver a crippling blow. Fifteen months ago,

> and suspended the planned withdrawal of US troops after July, while
> the security situation is re-assessed.
