*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是美国经济计划的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是石油价格的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

大概有五天的时间没有听写了，前三天是因为一门课的作业原因，忙得昏天黑地，干脆就把听写的事情给放弃了。昨天和前天却是一点都不想去做这件事情，不过今天又回来了。断断续续的听写，其实更加意识到自己在管理时间上的不足，也意识到自己实在意志力不坚定啊！前两天一个朋友在早起的那篇文章下面留言，说为什么早起也能写这么多，哎，实在是因为自己不像那个朋友那么强悍，想早起就可以早起……

</p>

今天的听写都比较容易，也没有太多好说的。前两天有朋友问我说自己都是怎么听写的，其实这个也挺简单的，不妨改天介绍一下。

==================================================

**题目**: The Candidates on the Economy (1/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: N/A

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> High food and fuel prices, housing and credit problems, job losses,
> worries about a recession. No wonder the economy is a top issue for
> American voters. Senator John McCain says tax cuts are needed for
> growth. The Republican presidential candidate
> ~~said~~<font color="red">set</font> out his economy plan in a speech
> this week in Pennsylvania. He would push congress to make President
> Bush's tax cuts permanent, and he would aim to lower the top rate of
> income tax for businesses from 35 percent to 25 percent. In all,
> Senator McCain proposes about 200 billion dollars,
> ~~a~~<font color="red">in</font> new tax cut for businesses and
> individuals. To help pay for them, he would cut earmarks, those
> special interest projects added to spending bills. He would also hold
> federal spending at most agencies to current levels and cut wasteful
> programs. But many experts say it is unlikely these cuts would equal
> the cost of the tax cuts. The campaigns of Democrats Barack Obama and
> Hillary Clinton dismissed the McCain plan as a continuation of George
> Bush's policies. Both Democrats say they are against tax cuts for the
> wealthy. They propose moderate cuts for the middle class.

==================================================

**题目**: Perfect Storm of Factors Driving Up Oil Prices, say Experts
(2/3)

</p>

**专有名词**: Steve Hanke, Johns Hopkins University

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Who is right in this debate, the energy traders or OPEC? They both
> are, according to Steve Hanke, professor of Applied Economics at Johns
> Hopkins University and a senior fellow at the Washington-based Cato
> Institute. Hanke says without a doubt current demand for oil exceeds
> supply.
>
> "We really had a surge in demand and a lot of this occurred as a
> result of rapid world growth, world growth has been increasing at a
> fairly high rate in the last 3 or 4 years, and to some extent
> ~~there~~<font color="red">it</font> has been energy intensive in use,
> because we <font color="red">have</font> had a fairly large increase
> in the middle class in a lot of these developing countries."
>
> But other factors contribute as well. Hanke says amid uncertainty and
> volatility in global stock markets, many investors have poured money
> into commodities, such as oil. This trend, combined with investor
> assumptions that oil prices will remain high, have helped boost prices
> further which has in turn fed more investor speculation in the market.
> Hanke says the weak US dollar does not help matters.
>
