*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，本期是关于ADHD以及知识产权新闻的第二部分。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*  

今天是听写的第五天，今天的慢速VOA当中，因为是和医学有些关系，Hugh对于一些医学中常出现的词反应总是要慢一些，不过还好能想起来。比如diagnose（诊断）,
symptom（症状）。相信经过昨天和今天这两篇ADHD的文章之后，大家至少了解了什么是ADD和ADHD不是吗？记得Deprate
Housewives里面Lynette就用了ADD相关的药物当作兴奋剂，扯远了……另外一篇造假的文章，相信大家已经记住了counterfeit（伪造）这个单词，因为多次出现了。  

第五天的任务完成，现在是早上七点半，Hugh准备去弄早饭吃了。国内的朋友已经是下午了，大家赶紧行动起来，开始今天的听写吧!

`The study found that rates and signs of ADHD are about the same in children there and in the United States. The Finnish children are rarely treated with medicines, while medication is widely used in the United States. Yet the study found the two populations have few differences with ADHD among older children and teenagers. Professor Smalley says medication is very effective in the short term. But she says the study raises important questions about the long-term effectiveness of current treatments. The study also found that only about half the Finnish children diagnosed with ADHD had deficit in short-term memory and self control. These cognitive deficits are generally considered part of the definition of ADHD. The study also found more evidence that ADHD symptoms change with age, hyperactivity and lack of self control decrease. But about two thirds of the children continue to show high levels of  inattention as children. The Journal of the American Academic of Children and Adolescence Psychiatry published the study. Even if drugs are used, experts say children with ADHD also need other help. For example, they need to learn organizational skills and they needs supportive adults.`

`In Northern Africa, for example, the executives say ninety percent of spare parts for automobiles are fake, leading to a large number of car accidents. Allen Drewsen, head of the International Trademark Association says counterfeit drugs  often send their own messages.“When you are dealing with people who are buying counterfeit baby food, counterfeit food product and counterfeit drugs, I am no expert on how to get the message out, but I can tell you that the message is fairly persuasive . The statics on the number of people in Africa who were dying from counterfeit anti-malarial drugs are very very shocking. So I think that's the message that has to be gotten across."BASCAP says public awareness campaign to call attention to the risk of piracy must be created on a country-to-country basis, taking in account the cultural differences. One of the best ways to get the message across, according to the group, is to work with creative people in local communities who are victims of piracy themselves.`[display\_podcast]
