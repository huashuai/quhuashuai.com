*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是中年腹部肥胖的新闻第二部分，标准VOA则是韩国总统访美的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天对照慢速VOA，看过去竟然没有红色的字，哈哈，实在是很开心。以往经常会出现一点小错误，或者其实不算做错误的错误，所以自己的一些听写习惯也在逐渐改变，比如说数字尽量按照英文敲出来，其实这样比我脑袋反应出数字快，也许脑袋太笨了。

</p>

至于标准VOA，有些地方挺郁闷的，韩国人的英语也有点奇怪，而且这段采访的声音偏小。对于the
Republic of Korea，我怎么就听成above the
Korea了呢。还有一些其他的地方，需要改进啊。已经有一周的时间没有写过别的内容了，就像上次说的，事情有些混乱，过几天写写感想。

**题目**: Study Links Midlife Belly Fat to Higher Risk of Dementia (2/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: Neurology, dementia, Rachel Whitmer, Kaiser Permanente,

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Those with the highest belly measurements had almost three times the
> risk of dementia compared to those with the lowest. Belly size
> appeared to make a difference even in patients with normal body
> weight. Belly size is linked to a kind of fat that grows around organs
> and produces harmful substances.
>
> Experts believe that belly fat is more dangerous than other kinds of
> fat cells that grow just under the skin. The researchers say this is
> the first study to demonstrate a link between midlife belly fat and
> the risk of dementia. Still, it is possible that this apparent
> connection could be the result of a complex set of health-related
> behaviors. The findings appeared in the journal Neurology.
>
> Rachel Whitmer from the Kaiser Permanente research division led the
> study. She says the findings do not explain why belly fat may be
> linked to dementia. But she says the study should send a warning.
> Other research has shown that brain changes linked to Alzheimer's
> disease might begin as early as young adulthood. And another study
> showed that belly fat in old people was tied to increased loss of
> brain cells.

> "Our relationship with the United States is very strong. We've been

>
> Han's words echoed those of President Lee himself, who held a

> his talks with President Bush at the Camp David retreat in Maryland.
> He says ~~(compare)~~<font color="red">compared</font> to previous
> South Korean administrations, his government will be more active in
> closely coordinating policy on North Korea with the United States.
> Some experts have criticized Mr. Lee's two most recent predecessors
> for seeking engagement and peaceful economic cooperation with the
> North at the expense of the alliance with the United States.
