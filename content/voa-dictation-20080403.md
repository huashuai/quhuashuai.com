*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是学校奖学金的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是关于气候行动计划的新闻的第三部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天的慢速VOA比较简单，只是这个activist没有听出来，其实也没有想到，还有比较奇怪的地方是把system听成了assistant，怎么也没想明白。其他的地方都很简单，几乎不会犯什么错误。

</p>

标准VOA中还是错了很多地方，主要是两段采访当中都有不少的地方没听准确。其实真的很迷惑，只是听的话，可能意思理解的差不多，写就总是错。而且采访内容，也就是非播音员的听起来确实难度大一些，继续适应提高。

</p>

今天决定不翻译文章了，很多人建议听写之后都应该好好翻译，相信一直坚持一样会有提高。Hugh的想法的听写完了之后看一遍，明白就好了，对于特别的短语，词汇弄明白，整体翻译起来确实需要的时间久一些，决定不花这些时间了。

<p>
> </p>
> Some American schools pay teachers more if their students improve on
> tests. Now there is a growing movement to pay the students. In some
> cases, even just for coming to class.
>
> Students at one school in New Mexico can earn up to 300 dollars a year
> for good attendance. A program in New York City pays up to 500 dollars
> for good attendance and high test scores.
>
> In Baltimore, Maryland, high scores on state graduation tests can be
> worth more than 100 dollars. And a New Jersey school system plans to
> pay students 50 dollars a week to attend after-school tutoring
> programs. Schools that pay students can be found in more than one
> fourth of the fifty states. Other schools pay students with food or
> other rewards.
>
> Robert Schaefer is public education director for the National Center
> for Fair and Open Testing and activist group. He says paying may
> improve performance in the short term, but students develop false
> expectations for the future. He sees a lack of long term planning in
> these programs because of pressure on schools to raise test scores.

==================================================

</p>

**专有名词**: Jonathan Shrier, post-Kyoto, Bill Becker,

</p>

**重点总结**: reduction（应该听出来）, viable（有活力的）, in the

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> "The G-8 countries would commit 2% reductions on average a year
> between 2010 and 2020, and then the 5 largest developing countries
> would kick in the 2% reductions all the way to 2050 and then
> eventually mid-century the smaller developing countries would be
> obligated to begin cutting as well."
>
> Jonathan Shrier says within the president's first 6 months, a plan
> must be readied for next round of climate negotiations that will set a
> post-Kyoto agenda.
>
> "The thought that a new administration again of either party would be
> able to hit the ground running and radically change the course of the
> international negotiations is unlikely in the extreme. So we really
> have to make this a viable kind of arrangement that is gonna work
> regardless of who's in the White House after this administration."
>
> Bill Becker says that can happen if the transition planning starts
> earlier even before the election. Becker says the president climate
> action project he directs has already identified the climate sensitive
> positions that need to be filled and a talent pool ready to take those
> jobs for the new president.
