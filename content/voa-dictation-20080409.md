*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是世界健康日的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是关于NCAA联赛的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

整天感觉今天的两篇难度都不是很大，相对来说标准VOA当中几个人名，以及采访过程中的话可能有一点困难。听得还是非常不错的！

</p>

昨天发现PR被清零了，开始以为是付费评论的问题，今天chada留言说可能是VOA的问题，我宁愿相信是前者。不过就算是因为VOA听写的原因，那我还是要继续听写下去。毕竟写博客不是为了Google写的，听写也不是为了Google听的。听写VOA，让Google惩罚去吧:-)
