*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是女性领袖的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是环境问题的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天的慢速VOA前些天听过一次类似的内容，不过应该是在标准VOA当中，我不确定自己的记忆力是不是足够好。除了一些国家和人名之外，没有任何困难，相信大家在听多了写多了的情况下，这些名字也不成为问题了。

</p>

标准VOA听写的倒是不差，就是很多小的问题，比如单词的大小写，听写的时候确实顾不上这个，而且有的内容确实也不知道到底是应该大写还是小写。对于amounts
to确实没有听出来，也没想到是这个词，继续坚持！

</p>

昨天休息了一天，没有听写，周末是应该稍微休息一下，否则真的很难一直连轴转，试着坚持保持一种很忙的状态，但是大概半个月之后会很疲劳，与其这样还不如定期让自己休息一下。比如多休息一会。

**原文**

<p>

> They note Congress is about to start work on new legislation dealing
> with the environment, and they stress~~ed~~ the 17 leading
> industrialized countries taking part in the Paris Negotiations this
> week hope to have an agreement by the end of next year, meaning the
> groundwork must be laid now. The president's proposals fall far below
> European goals to reduce emissions and environmental activists say the
> position taken by the President ~~amongst~~<font color="red">amounts
> to</font> too little, too late. Senator Barbara
> ~~Buckster~~<font color="red">Boxer</font>, the Democrat who chairs
> the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works, calls his
> approach the ~~hedge~~ of irresponsibility. But Mr. Bush defends it as
> realistic. The president warns climate change is a global problem and
> US action alone is not enough. He says other countries must come up
> with their own goals for cutting greenhouse gases. The Paris Talks on
> Thursday and Friday will address possible steps to protect the planet
> after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. The United States is the
> only major industrialized country that did not ratify the protocol,
> although emits more greenhouse gases than any other country.
