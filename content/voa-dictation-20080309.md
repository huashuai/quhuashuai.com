*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，本期的慢速VOA是关于好莱坞的，标准VOA则是关于社区安全的新闻。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*  

今天是听写的第7天了，今天的慢速VOA中没有遇到什么困难，基本上比较顺利的听写了下来，除了aim
to那个地方一下子没反应出来是啥。所以现在感觉听写的时候很多小词不容易写出来，可能是词短，发音也就短，不像那种长一点的词容易辨识。今天的标准VOA当中，理解整体意思没有任何问题，主要的地方还是和标准一样，小词的辨识需要提高。而且另外一点就是听写经常弄出一堆语法就说不过去的错误，如果只是写可能倒不会，就是因为速度快了就注意不了这些问题了。这可能也是需要提高的地方。  

第7天的任务完成，相信看到这篇文章的时候，国内的朋友已经是在下午了，大家赶紧行动起来，开始今天的听写吧!

`Hollywood also faces competition from illegally copied movies, a major issue to the Motion Picture Association of America. The trade group estimated more than 18 billion dollars in worldwide losses from piracy in 2005. Hollywood reporter Allen Silverman says piracy has influenced how American movies are released. In the past, Hollywood studios waited months after the American release of a  film to release it in foreign markets. Now, many aim to release  the same time around the world. Foreign markets may also influenced how people get their movies. Different nations have different levels of technology. Efforts to settle on the next generation DVD got a lot of attention recently. Sony's Blu-Ray technology for high definition television won the competition with Toshiba's HD DVD format. Yet, DVD sales have dropped in recent years. This maybe a sign that people are increasingly getting their movies off the internet. The internet is another front in Hollywood's war on piracy. But more than that, it presents complex business questions for an industry built on DVD and tickets sales.`

`A community responder from Baton Rouge. Louisiana spoke about his church's work in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which displaced hundreds of thousands residents in New Orleans and Golf Coast in 2005. Thomas Ray, a building contractor and ordained minister, is on the staff of a church called “the Chapel” on the campus of Louisiana State University. His church and others sprang into action to help victims of the hurricane by cooking food, collecting supplied and finding shelter and helping the injured get medical treatment. The church had no plan in place beforehand, but 5 days after the disaster, got together to coordinate their efforts.“We had one church that was really equipped, because of their daycare, and there are school, to handle moms who were pregnant and who had small children. So from that point on, everybody who showed up that was pregnant with a small child went to that particular church as a shelter. And we set resources that they would require to that church. So they were the storehouse for diapers and formula.”`[display\_podcast]
