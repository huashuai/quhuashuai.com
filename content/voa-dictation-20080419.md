*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是信贷危机的新闻第一部分，标准VOA则是教皇访美的新闻的第二部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天的慢速依然难度不大，有益的地方，在于一些金融领域内的词汇，大家可以试着记忆一下，免得和我第一次看到derivitive的时候还以为是导数呢！标准VOA当中应该说没有任何的口音问题，采访甚至更容易听写，因为语速要稍慢一些，播音员总是说的很快，什么时候我才能和他一样流利啊！

**题目**: Loan Crisis Throws New Light

**词汇**: securities（证券）, mortgage（抵押）, stockbroker（股票经纪人）

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Investment banks have long played a part in the financial system. But
> the recent crisis over securities based on risky home loans has
> brought them new attention. Investment banks handle stocks, bonds and
> other securities. They underwrite new offerings. That means they take
> the risk of buying the securities and reselling them to the public.
> They also provide business advice and market research, and dealing
> existing securities. Investment bankers have structured some newer
> securities in highly complex ways. Their value could be tied to lists
> of stocks, or prices of goods, or as the world now knows groups of
> risky home loans. These ~~mortgage
> back~~<font color="red">mortgage-backed</font> securities were sold to
> investors worldwide as a way to spread the risk. But as more and more
> loans went bad, the ~~markets~~<font color="red">market</font>
> collapsed. Before the nineteen thirties, the United States had no
> separation between traditional banking and investment banking
> activities. Bank holding companies could own other financial companies
> that would underwrite new stocks. They would also provide stockbroker
> services for the public. People often bought shares with money
> borrowed from the banks.
