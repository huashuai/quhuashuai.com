*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是亚洲HIV的新闻第二部分，标准VOA则是关于全美NCAA联赛的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

慢速VOA当中有个别地方还是没听出来，主要是自己的词汇问题，其实不仅要从发音上辨别，还要从意思上进一步推测这个词到底是哪个。这是体会到的一件事情，现在感觉慢速VOA更多实在积累词汇，呵呵，不知道对听力进一步提高是不是就要考标准VOA了。

</p>

今天的标准VOA内容不错，是篮球，如果你经常看ESPN的新闻，或者一些英文视频，相信对于里面很多词都很熟悉了，以及一些表达，Hugh也总结了几个。相反，不熟悉的朋友听起来可能有些费劲。所以说，这个东西，只要熟了怎么都好办！
