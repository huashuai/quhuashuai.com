今天开始尝试第一次听写，确实简单的听和听写差别太大了，有的单词听出来写不出来，有的单词干脆听不出来。相对来说慢速VOA还是比较适应的，只是一两个单词可能反应不出来是什么，而标准VOA的难度就要大一些了。每一篇听力Hugh都把文本配上了，这些文本是Hugh听写之后，对照论坛中的答案修改之后的结果，可能还是有一些错误，欢迎大家指出其中的错误。

今天的任务完成了，不过没有注意到底用了多少时间，明天起开始计时，毕竟时间上的缩短也是进步的一种表现。Hugh发完文章就准备去学校了，以后每天早上都会有一期VOA听写和大家见面，如果你还没有开始听写，马上来尝试一下吧！

One way it identifies promising entrepreneurs is through a business plan competition called Believe Begin Become. This is an intensive program that provides technical training and expert advice. Winners receive money to bring their business plans to reality. TechnoServe have held nine national competitions in Central America since 2002. Five competitions have been held in Africa, including one in Tanzania last year. BBB have been a breakthrough for me. finally I am going to own my own business and I am going to employ people.

`The two remaining candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, Senator Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have both warned of a pending recession and have laid the blames squarely on the Bush's administration. At a recent campaign debate in Texas, Obama spoke at length about country's economic walls(woes). `

” You don’t need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the
American people the economics is in trouble, because they have been
experiencing it for years now.”

Clinton followed up with a list of the specific economics trouble spots
that must be addressed starting with corporate tax regulations.

“We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and give-aways. We
are going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a
job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.”

Both said the tax cuts championed by Present Bush have helped only the
richest Americans, and vowed to put more focus on tax relief for the
middle class.</code>
