*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是学校奖学金的新闻第二部分，标准VOA则是关于英军从伊拉克撤军的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天的慢速VOA算是这段时间以来听的相当不错的了，除了两个忘记变复数的名次，还有一个is/was的问题之外，就没有什么错误了。我想主要的原因还是难度没有那么高，而且听的时候确实也比较认真吧。继续努力！

</p>

今天的标准VOA听上去很象BBC，口音上很像。还是一如既往的错，听了这么久犯的还是那些错误。一部分是听不出来，一部分是听错了，Hugh还在思考应该怎么解决这个问题，听不出来还好，听错了就很郁闷，容易导致意思都理解错误。其实主要还是对于这种日常的语音的不适应，以及一些表达的不熟悉。试想如果很熟悉的表达，相信你猜也能猜个大概，所以坚持看新闻吧！

(2/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: Coshocton, Ohio, Eric Bettinger

</p>

**重点总结**:

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Public schools need to show improvement under the education reform law
> signed by President Bush six years ago. Low-performing schools may
> lose their federal money. Teachers and administrators may lose their
> jobs.
>
> Often these schools are in poor neighborhoods where getting students
> to go to school can be a continual problem. Critics say paying
> students sends a message that money is the only valuable reward. But
> some students say it makes school more exciting. And some teachers
> have reported getting more requests for extra help.
>
> In 2004, the city schools in Coshocton Ohio, launched a program. They
> wanted to see if paying elementary school students as much as 100
> dollars would help in passing state exams. Now Eric Bettinger of Case
> Western Reserve University has reported mixed results. Math scores
> increased, but only while students were able to get paid. And there
> was no evidence of higher scores in reading, social studies and
> science.
>
> Officials will decide later this year whether to continue the program.
> Yet adults get paid for their work. And if teachers can be rewarded
> for their students' work, then why not the students themselves. This
> is what some people say.

>
> "In October we announced our plan for drawing down UK troops from

> returned when the two sides agreed to a cease-fire on Monday.
