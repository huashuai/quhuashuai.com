*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，本期的慢速VOA是关于可持续发展的第一部分，标准VOA则是关于社区安全的新闻的第三部分。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*  

今天是听写的第8天了，今天慢速VOA当中还是在一些小词上面除了问题，像第一句当中的will
that，听了两遍就是没有想出来是什么。另外就是认识了一个很常用的单词，bad
net，呵呵，就是蚊帐的意思，以前从来也没想过蚊帐到底是什么。今天的标准VOA当中出现了一些生词，尤其是动词，像我在Key
Points里面写的一样，另外像catastrophe这个应该是在GRE单词里面背过，印象不深了，所以说词汇量还是很重要的。  

第8天的任务完成，相信看到这篇文章的时候，国内的朋友已经是在下午了，大家赶紧行动起来，开始今天的听写吧!

`If you give something to someone for free, will that person evaluate it and use it? Development experts have debated this question for decades. Some say the act of paying causes people to value something and use it more. Others argue that selling necessary healthy treatment may deny them to the people who need them the most. Consider, for example. chemically treated bed nets. These bed net kill mosquitoes and protect people against malaria when they are sleeping. New York University economist William Easterly says this is one example of development gone wrong. In a recent book, Prof. Easterly suggests bed nets given freely in Africa are often used for the wrong purpose. Yet, the world health organization recommends bed nets be given out freely and used by whole communities. The success of a large free bed nets campaign in Kenya let the WHO to announce this recommendation last August. The debate will likely influence social programs in the developing world. Many non-governmental organizations support the creation of self-sustaining programs in poor countries. Goods and services are sold for a price to help these programs survives.`

`Church members volunteered their labors to create a hospital in an abandoned shopping  center.“We had to rewire the building, re-plumb it. Then we have to clean it and then divide it up into the various functions that are required in a hospital and then equip it.” They got help from Federal Officials, but mostly relied on their own ingenuity and personal contacts. In little more than 24 hours, the volunteers had 500-bed hospital running. Doctor Fielding says personal hygiene is important in any catastrophe, and simple measures  such as hand-washing can limit the spread of disease. He says hygiene is vital in a flu pandemic, which could infect from 25 to 50 of the US population. Public health official knows that three pandemics occurred in the last century, including the serious outbreak of Spanish Influenza in 1918. Fielding says pandemics and other disaster are unavoidable and in a sprawling multi-ethnic region like L.A. community group can play a vital role in helping people get through the disaster.`[display\_podcast]
