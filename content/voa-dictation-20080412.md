*欢迎来到“杂乱的书桌”每天准时为你带来的VOA听写，**本期的慢速VOA是美国人上高中的新闻第二部分，标准VOA则是关于安吉丽娜朱莉的新闻的第一部分**。还犹豫什么，赶紧和Hugh一起加入到学习英语，锻炼听写的队伍中来吧！*

</p>

今天稍微改变了一下文章发表的方式。以前总是把修改好了的原文贴出来，这样倒不如把错误贴出来更好，免得给大家造成Hugh总是听对的假象，哈哈！所以从今天开始，尽管贴出来的仍然是原文，不过把错误用红色标注出来了，大家也可以了解到Hugh是什么水平。同样的，这样子更有利于Hugh自己观察进步，什么时候红色都没有了，就是perfect了！

</p>

不知道大家对于这样的改变有什么想法呢？个人觉得更真实可信了！

> high school. They estimate the number at more than one million each
> year.
>
> The report was prepared for America's <font color="red">Promise</font>
> Alliance. The private group aims to help children receive services
> they need to succeed. General <font color="red">Colin Powell</font>
> was chairman of America's <font color="red">Promise</font> Alliance
> when it was formed in nineteen ninety-seven. He attended the press
> conference Tuesday where the report was released. He said studies have
> shown that the United States must do more to educate the leaders and
> <font color="red">work force of</font> the future.
>
> Secretary of Education <font color="red">Margaret</font> Spellings
> also spoke. She said the government will propose that states use the
> same methods when reporting graduation rates. Alliance officials also
> announced the start of a nationwide campaign to improve graduation
> rates. It is to include a series of meetings to be held in every state
> over the next two years. The meetings will bring together elected
> leaders, business <font color="red">owners,</font> students, parents
> and education officials. They will develop plans to increase the
> number of Americans who finish high school.

**题目**: Angelina Jolie Discusses Plight of Iraqi Children (1/2)

</p>

**专有名词**: Jolie, David Petraeus, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon,
George Rupp

</p>

**原文**

<p>
> </p>
> Jolie again used her star power to speak out for children in war
> zones, on the day <font color="red">the</font> top U S military
> commander in Iraq, General David <font color="red">Petraeus</font>
> testified before congressional committees. Asked about her view of how
> the surge of additional American troops has impacted Iraqi children,
> Jolie said military action must go hand in hand with aid.
>
> "I would think even <font color="red">Petraeus</font> would agree that
> a surge does not just mean it works if you get numbers of violence
> <font color="red">down.</font> It works if humanitarian aid is
> starting to increase and changes are able to be made. "
>
> Half of the four million Iraqis forced out of their homes are
> internally displaced. Tens of thousands have
> <font color="red">fled</font> to Syria and Jordan, and much smaller
> numbers of Iraqi refugees are in Egypt and Lebanon. The president of
> the International Rescue Committee, George
> <font color="red">Rupp,</font> said he had met with many Iraqi
> families seeking shelter in Syria and Jordan. He said despite the
> tremendous efforts of those two countries, the situation for the
> refugees is deplorable.
